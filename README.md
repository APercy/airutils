Airport Utils for Minetest

This mod is a lib and offers utilities to be used in airports.
We have only 2 items now, but will be expanded as needed.

The first is PAPI (Precision Approach Path Indicator), to guide you in approaching landings. I recommend this article from wikipedia to understand how it works: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision ... _indicator

The PAPI is usually located on the left-hand side of the runway at right angles to the runway center line, so, if you want to place it at right side, just right click it to invert lights order.


The second, the tug, allows the repositioning of aircraft that may be blocking the runway or taxiways. In my mods only the owner can fly his own plane, so with this tool, if the person owns the area or the area has no owner, it is possible to move the aircraft without the presence of the pilot. Just click to move, and shift + click to rotate in your direction
